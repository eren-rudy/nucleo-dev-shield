1. **OpenOCD** (Open On-Chip Debugger) will be used for flashing (and maybe debugging, if necessary). The [OpenOCD User's Guide](http://openocd.org/doc/pdf/openocd.pdf) provides a good overview of OpenOCD's capabilities. OpenOCD is a software package that enables flashing, debugging (using GDB), and boundary scan testing of a target device (ie the nRF52810 SoC) using a debug adapter (such as J-Link, ST-Link, or any JTAG-enabled adapter). The OpenOCD documentation emphasizes that it's primarily focused on its JTAG capabilities.
